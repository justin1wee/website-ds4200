        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>
            I’m an aspiring Data Engineer studying Data Science and Business at Northeastern University, graduating in Spring 2026. I’m passionate about machine learning, cloud computing, and data infrastructure, and I enjoy exploring how these technologies connect to create efficient, scalable systems. I like building things that make data more accessible and meaningful — from optimizing pipelines to experimenting with AWS services like EC2, S3, and Lambda in collaborative projects. I approach problems with both structure and creativity, always aiming to design clean, reliable solutions. I’m naturally curious and enjoy continuously learning — whether that’s diving deeper into SQL, predictive analytics, or emerging trends in AI and fintech.
        </p>

            Outside of academics, I value maintaining a balanced lifestyle through fitness, personal development, and time with the people who matter most to me. I believe growth comes from both technical challenges and self-awareness, and I try to bring that mindset into everything I do. My goal is to build a career that bridges engineering and analytics, helping organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions while continuing to evolve as both a professional and a person.
